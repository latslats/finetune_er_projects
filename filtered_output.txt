There’s nothing more exciting than a new toy, especially when @earthrated drops 5 brand new toys in their first-ever toy collection and they're PERFECT! #earthratedpartner 

River can honestly be so picky about toys, but she loves every single one of these toys and has been playing with them every day for the past month. 

One of my goals for this year is to teach River to catch a disc because she loves to jump and I think she would really enjoy it. So, I have been working with her daily using their Fly toy to teach her how to catch it in the air and she gets so excited when it’s time to go outside to practice! 

We also start every morning with a potty break and 5-10 minutes playtime outside with the Tug toy and River comes back in panting, happy and ready for a nap while I get started with work! It’s perfect for our everyday early morning playtime and exercise! 

I am just so impressed with the thought and design behind each #earthrated toy in this collection - every single detail down to the shape, color, and texture of the toys was designed to stimulate your dog and provide enrichment! River can confirm  that too as she's obsessed with each one!

It was a motivation to get moving. For me, it was to push my limits and accomplish something new.⁠

Top tip for saving your sanity with a mischievous puppy #ad

@earthrated is all about making life with dogs simpler and better👏🏼 I’m sharing my top tip for making life with a puppy easier: learning “drop it”

Let’s face it, puppies get into things they shouldn’t. Aura is extremely interested in everything she sees right now and a lot of times acts faster than I would like

My top tip for getting a puppy to drop items they should not have is to make it all about trading - giving them something better in exchange. I’m finding high value treats a lifesaver! Thankfully she’s figuring this out fast and mostly prefers treats over used tissues😉

As a dog mom, I’m constantly looking for products that make a positive impact in my daily life and routine with Maisie, and @earthrated’s dog wipes 100% fit that description #ad 

For over a year now, we’ve been using @earthrated’s dog wipes after every adventure, no matter how big or small (we love the Lavender scented ones but they are available unscented too!) They’ve become a huge part of our outdoor regimen and have made a big difference in decreasing paw itchiness as well as a quick form of cleanup after an outing. I love that we’ve been able to overcome the allergy symptoms and cleanliness issues that come with being outdoors all with the help of one product. 

This month is a great time to stock up on these (and more!) must-haves from Earth Rated thanks to their Black Friday sale! Check out our stories to see their deals and head to the link in our bio to shop! #earthrated #earthratedpartner

What I love about @earthrated is how they’ve combined functionality with their sleek new look!! #ad 

Not only do the Earth Rated products look even nicer now, they function better too. My favourite part is the yellow hook on the back of the dispenser for your used poop bags so you don’t have to carry them in your hand! Who knew something as simple as this could make such a huge difference on walks?! Apollo thinks I look as cool as I can picking up his poop now! 😆

Pack it in, pack it out! #EarthRatedPartner

The number one thing people hate to see on the trails is bags of dog poop that people swore they’d pick up on the way back! We see so many tied up poo bags unfortunately—this is why they start closing trails to dogs :( 

We love the new @earthrated poop bag dispensers and their easy hook to hold our lavender-scented poop bags all hike long!!

What’s your hiking pet peeve?

One of the best tricks I’ve taught Apollo is “hold” 🙌 #ad 

As someone that often takes photos featuring different items/products (#dogfluencer life), this trick is one that works so well for photos! 

Here is how I taught Apollo to hold! Make sure to SAVE this post so you can teach your dog! ☺️

•Start with an object that your dog would already pick up! (Like a toy) 
•When your dog sniffs or interacts with the toy, either use your clicker or say “good” or “yes” then feed a reward.
•Start to only click/reward when your dog puts their mouth around or on the toy
•Introduce the word “hold” once your dog is consistently putting the toy in their mouth 
•Once they understand that “hold” means to put their mouth around the toy, start building up the time you want them to hold it for. 
•Once they will hold for a duration of time, you can teach a cue like “okay” or “drop” when you’re ready for them to release it.
•Once they’ve mastered that, you can start trying it with different objects! 

Check out Apollo holding all his @earthrated products!!

Have you ever seen a dog NOT make a giant mess with a pup cup? | ad

Bodie is a pup cup aficionado, but he still hasn’t mastered the art of enjoying them gracefully 😂

To be prepared, we always keep @earthrated dog wipes in our car. They come in handy for pup cups, dirty paws, muddy fur - you name it. No car survival kit is complete without them.

They’re plant based AND hypoallergenic, giving Bodie a safe, gentle clean every time we need it (which.... is often).

Might be a good idea to stock up on Black Friday! 💚

3. Have lots of treats to reward your pup and keep sessions short so they remember photoshoots are lots of fun.

Learn how to use enrichment to improve your dog’s behavior! #ad

@EarthRated has launched a new line of toys and me being the dog-enrichment-loving nerd that I am, I had to try the Treat Toy first!

Enrichment is a wonderful and easy way to help improve your dog’s behavior while also providing much-needed mental stimulation. Consider enrichment activities like this to help calm your dog down around guests, to decrease unwanted behaviors like jumping and barking, to keep them busy while you take that work call, and to help tire them out on days when you can’t get outside for exercise.

This @earthrated Treat Toy has quickly become one of our favorites! It’s made from natural rubber, which is super durable while also being soft enough to be gentle on Jade’s teeth (and my floors & furniture!) when she’s tossing and rolling it around. It’s also dishwasher and freezer safe, which is always a big plus for us when getting new dog toys. It’s unique shape means it wobbles, rolls, and tumbles around to keep your dog engaged and provide a great outlet to forage for their food.

Fill this toy with your dog’s dry food and/or favorite treats and watch them engage in a fun and rewarding task, while also helping tire them out a bit!

You can find & shop the entire @EarthRated toy collection online now @Chewy.

So you’ve closed your dispenser without aligning the slits and now it’s stuck? To get it open again, pull the top and bottom pieces apart, as hard as you can! To avoid this happening again, make sure the slit on the top piece is lined up with the slit on the bottom piece of your dispenser. Twist until you hear a click to lock both pieces in place.

Providing a temporary home for a pup until they find their forever home can mutually benefit both dog and human. Fostering a dog can also have a huge impact on animal rescues by freeing up crucial space for other dogs in need of shelter. We spoke to four organizations close to our hearts to learn more about the positive impact fostering can have on shelters. (link in bio)

Leave some 🐾🐾🐾 in the comments if your pup is on team muddy paws!

Luna may love to roll in stinky stuff and get her paws muddy, but I still think she’s stinkin’ wonderful! Having @earthrated wipes on hand is a must to keep the stinkin’ outside and bring just the wonderful inside.

We put the new @eathrated enrichment toys to the ultimate golden test #ad

My first impression: stylish! These toys are extra durable and thoughtfully made for enrichment🐶

CHEW is a multiuse toy that can be filled with soft treats and also functions as a bully stick holder - genius. TREAT is a fun dispenser toy that’s easy to fill with dry treats or kibble. A great amount of mental challenge

Dog mom bonus points to dish washer safe toys!👌🏽

PSA: Earth Rated just released their new TOYS!!! #ad 
@earthrated just released their new toy collection and guess who got their paws on them 👀🐾 This collection is so thoughtfully designed and I really admire the attention to detail, like the fact that the in motion toys are yellow (which is a color dogs can actually see!) and that the toys are tested against some of the same safety standards as children’s toys 🤯 I’m stoked that these toys are enriching, engaging, aesthetically pleasing and safe, and that Maisie has been so eager to play with them! This truly is a better way to play 💚 
You can find them all now on Amazon.  #earthrated #earthratedpartner

POV: Your dogs don’t care that it’s cold out 🥶🐶 

This time of year the Canadian prairies are cold, but having dogs that absolutely live for the outdoors makes it quite hard to say no to a snowy adventure. January is National Walk Your Dog Month, which is ironic considering those cold temps, but I do always find that with pups that love to adventure it makes it easier to get myself and my own body moving as well! Living an active lifestyle is so important to me and I feel so lucky that my pups get me out in the fresh air during these shorter days to stay consistent and active. 👏🏽

And of course, bringing our favourite @earthrated toys along doesn’t hurt either. They’ve got some great tips & giveaways going on right now to help make the most of the season, so go follow and join in on the fun!! 🤩 🫶🏼 🐾

I’d love to know, do your dogs make it easier to get outdoors, even in the middle of a cold, dark, winter? ❄️ 🐾

Here’s a low-key Valentine’s Day date night idea for you and your pooch. 🥰 

1) Grab a cozy blanket to get the setup just right. 
2) Get their favourite enrichment toy ready with their favourite snack (Butters’ is the Earth Rated Chew toy stuffed with some good ol’ peanut butter. 
3) Sit down with them and enjoy! 

Much like Butters, they’ll be head over heels in love with you for it... and their treat(s). 😘 Just maybe have some Earth Rated wipes close by to clean the mess off their face. 😂 @earthrated #earthrated #earthratedpartner

Just because your dog gets messy, doesn’t mean your house has to! #ad 

We’ve all felt that dread as your dog runs through your house leaving a masterpiece of dirty paw prints behind them. That’s exactly why I keep a pack of @earthrated wipes at the door at all times!

Life with dogs is pretty stinkin wonderful, especially when you can rid of the dirt before it enters your house! I love exploring outdoors with Apollo but once we get home, I prefer to keep the outdoors, outside.

Earth Rated has a new look with great upgrades! It makes clean ups with Apollo easier so we can spend more time adventuring! #ad @earthrated 

Some of my favourite upgrades include:
•the minimalist look of the poop bag holder which dispenses smoothly, locks bags securely inside and has a hook for used bags
•the 100% leak proof bags that now come with a 3 bags left warning
•the gentle wipes that are durable but extra soft and hypoallergenic 

In honour of these amazing upgrades, I’m giving away 1 Earth Rated essentials bundle for a Canadian follower! (Scroll to the last slide to see the prize pack) Here are the rules: 🛑 CLOSED 🛑

Earth Rated is continuing its tradition of observing September 30th as the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. Our office will be closed for the occasion.⁠
⁠
Our team was lucky enough to attend a workshop led by Dolorès, from UAPASHKUSS, an organization committed to protecting and recognizing Innu sacred natural sites. We began working with Dolorès last year through our support of the Pakatakan Project, a partnership in collaboration with @snapquebec.⁠
⁠
We are so grateful to Dolorès for taking the time to meet with us and share her rich culture and history.

⬇️Comment ‘WALKS’⬇️ to have the links for Better Walks items & training resources sent to your inbox!
 
Tips:
 
1. Dogs are pretty excited when they get out for their walks.  Playing some high energy games can help get some of that energy out so they’re less likely to pull you.  I like to finish it off with a treat scatter, to help bring the energy level back down to neutral.

2. Dogs move a lot faster than us & have a lot more interest in the environment.  Giving them a long line so they have more space allows them to move around quickly, sniffing & enjoying the environment, without pulling us.

3. I like to use an S-Biner (attached to my fanny pack) so I can be hands free. Who doesn’t like to be hands free?

4. My mind was blown when I found out the @earthrated poop bag dispenser doubled as a poop bag holder.  Again, necessary hands-free miracle.

5. And finally, our magnetic treat pouch.  I used a pull tie one for a long time & bought this one for myself for Christmas & it’s a game changer for when I have gloves on… so much easier to quickly access treats!
 
BONUS: We’re also including some FREE webinars from some qualified trainers to help with everything from loose leash walking to leash reactivity!
 
Make sure you follow @earthrated & @toosmartdogs for more tips to help you and your dog! 🐾

Life’s too short to struggle with poop bags–especially when you count in dog years.⁠
⁠
If you find regular bags a pain to open, our handle bags are here to help. Just tug the handles to open, and tie the handles tight to secure the (poop) bag. They’re extra wide and big enough to fit a cat litter scoop, making them the perfect double doody picker upper.⁠

Our furry best friends deserve pampering too! 😊 #ad

Taking some time throughout the day to reset, refresh, and recharge can truly make the day better - especially, if we include our dogs in the fun.

☀️ Reset: Stop what you're doing and head outside for a nice walk or some patio time. Getting some fresh air and some sun can do a lot for us and our dogs.

💦 Refresh: Take a moment to freshen up (reapply moisturizer, hydrate with some water, etc.) Get your pup cleaned up using some dog wipes and make sure to give them a treat afterwards!

🔋 Recharge: Give yourself permission to sit down in a comfortable spot and enjoy a snack, drink, or maybe even a special treat. While you do that, give your dog a tasty chew activity somewhere relaxing as well.

✨ Doing things like this each day/week can further enhance the already awesome bond you have with your pup. 💚

What are your favorite ways to reset, refresh, and recharge with your dog?

Thanks to @earthrated for all the great products that help us pamper our pups! 🐾

Let dogs be dogs. It may get stinky, it may get dirty, but with @earthrated dog wipes, you can be prepared for less stress and less mess! #ad

I used to catch myself trying to interrupt my dogs from things that would get them dirty. Jade loves to rub up on our privacy trees in our yard, Bruce likes to dig and rub his body on anything stinky, and Freddie really enjoys a good nap in a dirt pile. Recently, I have been making an effort to not try to stop them and instead let them be dogs and get a little dirty. 

Not only is it fun and enriching for the dogs, but it gives me a chance to put our dog wipes to good use and get some training in too.

What ways do your dogs like to get dirty? Let me know in the comments!

Keep your dog calm while wiping them off with these 3 tips! #ad

Life with dogs is amazing, but it can get messy sometimes. If you have trouble keeping your dog calm and/or still when trying to clean them, try these techniques to make wiping them off easier, faster, and less stressful!

We are always stocked up on our favorite unscented dog wipes from @earthrated since our dogs love to get messy at the park and in our backyard. Thanks to these dog wipes, I can be less of a helicopter mom when my dogs start digging in the dirt, rolling on the grass, or frolicking in the bushes.

What are some ways your dog tells you that they love you? | sponsored

Here's Widgets love language:

- When he takes a 💩 on our walk around the neighborhood right beside the ONLY garbage can. I love our @earthrated dispenser because it always carries his poop for me, but it's always nice to dispose of it right away too! ❤

- Widget has learned that when we get home from walks he has to wait at our front entrance for me to wipe down his paws with our @earthrated wipes. It's nice to know that he's not going to just run into the house and get my floors dirty. 😂

- When I've had a tough day, Widget can sense it. He's always ready to cheer me up by bringing me his favourite toy. He's been loving our @earthrated fly toy we got, and playing a quick game of fetch is a great way for me to destress and have some fun!

I want to know your dog's love language! 💕

Info for BONUS Tips👇🏻 Save for Later 🤝🏻
 
Recall is an essential skill in my house. We spend the majority of our time off leash in the woods.
 
Building the skills slowly & gradually is so important.  Setting the dogs up for success & staying consistent with rewards is key!
 
Tip 1: Keep it positive & never scold your dog. The last thing you want is for your dog to make the association that reuniting with you is going to make them feel terrible. So keep it positive no matter what!
 
Tip 2: Use a longline! One of the biggest mistakes people make is letting their dog off leash before they’re ready. If they have the opportunity to practice not listening, it’s more likely to happen again in the future. So keep them on a longline until you’re confident they will be successful.
 
Tip 3: don’t call them when they’re engaged in the environment, this sets them up for failure. Wait until they finish sniffing & then call them!
 
Bonus tip: always keep a wide variety of rewards on hand. I like to keep single ingredient meat treats & some toys!

Hersh loves being on the furniture at home (and we love giving him access to it). He also loves to roll in stinky stuff so we make sure to leave the dirt (and smell) at the door after each walk by using @EarthRated wipes. They work really well at grabbing dirt while being gentle on his body. 

Earth Rated makes makes the messy part of dog parenting a little easier. And that’s stinkin’ wonderful.

Shining a light on an important occasion like National Adopt a Shelter Dog Month, not only helps raise awareness but also may even encourage people to make room in their hearts for dogs in need. Here at Earth Rated, our team is chock full of people who have experience both fostering and adopting dogs! Because nothing beats advice from people who’ve done it all before, we asked them for their top tips:⁠
⁠
- Create a small safe space for the new dog to stay in case they're not comfortable in a crate.⁠
⁠
- Stock up on the essentials like Poop Bags & Grooming Wipes (remember baths can be stressful)⁠
⁠
- Offer a mix of soft toys, balls, hard toys, etc to see what interests them the most.⁠
⁠
- Avoid using any unfamiliar food or treats for the first week.⁠
⁠
- Try using white noise for stress reduction.⁠
⁠
- If the new dog is being brought into a new home that already has animals, try keeping the pup in a separate space for the first few hours until all animals can smell each other through the door and adjust to new scents.⁠
⁠
- Keep in touch with the rescue/shelter in case of emergencies or general questions.

I love that @earthrated’s new toys are affordable enough to spoil your pup with all of them, and come in small and large sizes to tailor to your pup. It’s no surprise that they knocked it out of the park AGAIN with how these toys are thoughtfully designed for enrichment & fun! 

You know we’re a fan of anything enrichment, so the Treat and Chew toys were a big hit here. We also discovered that the Fetch toy makes the perfect mini basketball with its unpredictable bounce! 🏀

3 ways to use @earthrated’s new Treat and Chew toys for enrichment! | ad

Bodie has been going wild for his new @earthrated toys. We decided to put the Treat and Chew to the test with some of his favorite snacks. 

Judging by the way he immediately brought these all back to me for a refill once he cleaned them out, I think it’s safe to say he’s a big fan.

Shop the collection on Amazon and let us know if you try them out!

Luna knows that sometimes, it’s the little things that help get me motivated to walk her! We’ve tried out the upgraded @earthrated products over the past few weeks, and here’s how they’ve made walks easier on hectic days:

🐾 Minimalist bag dispenser = never forgetting bags

🐾 Sticker when the roll is almost out = never being caught without

Earth Rated makes sure every day is an easy day, and I love ‘em for that! ☺️💕 #earthratedpartner @earthrated #ad

Here’s my top dog parent life hack to never be caught without poop bags! 

I STASH ‘EM! 

Yes, that’s right. I recommend stashing a roll everywhere and anywhere you think you’d ever need a poop bag. I stock up on our favorite bags from @earthrated and make sure all my stash-spots are fully stocked! 

Here are the top 3 places I always have a stash: 
1) In the car 
2) By the back and/or front door
3) In your treat pouch/walking bag/purse 

In addition, @earthrated has added a "3 bags left" sticker on every roll making it even easier to never be caught without a bag.

Where do you keep your poop bag stashes? Let me know in the comments!

3 tips for the dog parents this fall 🍁 | AD

It’s almost that time of the year when the days are shorter and we spend more time indoors with the colder weather, so we wanted to share a few of our favorite tips for how we prep for the “great indoors” and make the most of our time together!

1️⃣ We like to go on a "sniffari" for mental enrichment in the morning! A 20-30 minute sniffari can be just as tiring as an hour-long walk without sniffing.

2️⃣ I make sure to plan daily enrichment activities for River indoors, like teaching her a new trick, using a snuffle mat, filling an @earthrated Chew toy with peanut butter, or playing hide and seek with  her favorite toys and treats.

3️⃣ Lastly, I always make sure to use dog grooming wipes weekly her paws to avoid those seasonal environmental allergies.

We’d love to know what your favorite tips are too, drop them below!

Make Bath Time Less Scary with These 3 Tips: #ad 🛁 
 
1) Make the bath/bathroom area cozier with the help of familiar items, like a bed or blanket and their favorite chew.

2) Provide enrichment in or near the bathroom area. You can use things like puzzles and treat dispensing toys filled with some food and treats.

3) Use rewards to help build more positive associations around the area. Depending on your dog's fear, treat them for things like wal  near the bathroom, looking at the tub, and jumping in/out of the tub, etc.

*Bonus Tip* 4) Consider other means of keeping your dog clean, like dog wipes, to help clean them in between baths and while you're training them to overcome their fear. 

⭐️ The goal is to help your dog view the bathroom/bath area as a thing where other fun and positive things happen!

I’m here today to share 2 life hacks that make poo pickup time with Apollo easier! @earthrated #ad 

My first life hack is making frozen pumpkin + goat milk treats for Apollo. They’re delicious and perfect on a warm day! Pumpkin is great for your dog’s tummy and goat milk is loaded with probiotics which means your dogs’s 💩 should be more pleasant to pick up too!

Secondly, the Earth Rated poop bag dispenser has a hook on the back so once you pick up your dog’s 💩, you don’t have to hold it in your hand. Just hook it on and throw it out at the next garbage you come by! 

What life hack makes life with your dog easier?

Is Mackenzie afraid of going to new places? #Ad

Over the years, I’ve practiced positive reinforcement with Mackenzie by bringing her favourite toys (currently she is LOVING the @earthrated Fetch Toy) and I’ll play “Go Find” and “Fetch” with her to let her know that we’re in a safe and fun environment.

I’ve found that this not only helps boost her confidence when going on new adventures, this also helps to create core memories with each other. ❤

How do you and your pets acclimate to new environments?

Does anyone else feel like the days started getting waaaaaaaay shorter out of NOWHERE? | ad

Last year, I was not prepared for how much this would impact our usual exercise routine with Bodie. This year, I feel MUCH better about taking on the challenge that is keeping a high energy dog occupied when the sun sets early. 

Our top 3 tips for helping your dog adjust to shorter days:
• Add mental games to meal time (we love the @earthrated Treat)
• Keep their routine regular & gear up with illuminated accessories for your evening walks
• Start an indoor training program for some mental & physical exercise 

What do you do to tackle shorter days with your dogs?

The best Halloween costumes are the ones that give back to dogs in need! 💚 #earthratedpartner

In honor of Adopt a Shelter Pet month, our friends at @earthrated are bringing back their yearly Shelter Superhero campaign! Since 2009, Earth Rated has donated over 14,000 fleece blankets to shelter and rescue dogs in need. As a foster, I know how important it is to have a ton of easy to clean, warm, and packable blankets on hand for our puppies, and I know shelters and rescues feel the same! A lot of shelters here in Texas are partially outdoors, and with the colder weather coming through it’s essential that these facilities have blankets they can rely on. The best part, though? We’re asking YOU to nominate a shelter or rescue you love to receive a donation of @earthrated ‘s exclusive fleece blankets! 🐾

Click the link in my bio or on my stories to nominate your local shelter, the rescue you volunteer for, or a facility you know and love. We chose our favorite Houston rescue, @caitiesfosterfamrescue, to donate our box of blankets to. They have helped us save so many Houston dogs in need, and I am so happy that I’m able to give back to them in a small but impactful way. Ready to nominate your favorite shelter or rescue? Head to the link in our bio! Don’t forget to tell Baloo that his costume is super. 😉

PS: the dogs in this video are ADOPTABLE from @caitiesfosterfamrescue ! 😍

10’s across the board in my books! Lenny’s got her preferences though, as I’m sure your dog does too 🐶 Good thing this launch has something for every pup 😍 | ad 
 
Lenny’s favs as a 32 lb gentle, fetch-fanatic: 
 
- FETCH (obviously) 
- TREAT (bit of a brainiac) 
- FLY (another floater!!) 
 
CHEW would be awesome for holding bully sticks or for dogs who love to chew 🦴  
 
And TUG would be SO good for a rough & tough typa dog 💪🏼  
 
You can shop the new collection in our Amazon storefront! 🛒

Dog Enrichment Obstacle Course for the Great Indoors! #ad

🐾 Here’s how to do it:

- grab some of your dog’s favorite toys and place them around
- fill a treat dispensing toy and add that to the course
- hide some treats around the toys and items

Sit back and watch your dog enjoy this unique enrichment game! This type of activity is great for any type of day, but can be especially helpful on days where you think you may be spending more time inside.

I couldn’t contain my excitement when @earthrated announced they were making toys!! #ad 

Time to meet the collection! ⬇️

Fetch: a thoughtfully designed ball with a unique shape that bounces unpredictably and floats! 

Tug: designed with 2 handles for interactive play and an ergonomic shape, supporting natural range of motion!

Chew: a re-imagination of a traditional bone, allowing dogs to chew, chomp and gnaw at dry treats, peanut butter or bully stick you’ve stuffed it with!

Treat: a fully interactive and rewarding experience for your dog with a wobbly rolling shape that provides mental stimulation! 

Fly: an engaging toss, jump and catch experience with a rolled edge and hollow centre to ensure any dog can pick it up. It also floats for fun in the water! 

Each toy is made from natural rubber and rigorously tested for toughness!! 💪🏻 

Which one would your dog love??
💚💛 Apollo’s top picks are Fetch and Chew! 🏆

“Have you ever had that mortifying moment where your dog is pooping and you don’t have a poop bag?⁠
⁠
I’ve been there and it is incredibly embarrassing and awkward. I’ll even admit, I have even pretended to pick it up just so I look less irresponsible, and I never want to have to do that again! Sure, it is easy to forget a bag, but really it doesn’t have to be! Especially with the @earthrated poop bag dispensers that can attach easily to a leash or a pack and even has a built-in clip to carry used bags!"

Our latest and greatest tool for travel prep: @earthrated’s Chew Toy #ad

While prepping for our latest trip, having an engaging and durable toy like Earth Rated’s Chew Toy was a huge help for getting Maisie accustomed to her carrier. Prior to flying we like to reintroduce her carrier accompanied by high value treats and engaging toys like this one to encourage her to interact with and spend time in her carrier. Being able to travel with Maisie is such a privilege and her comfort and confidence is so important, and I’m thankful that Earth Rated has such engaging and practical toys to help us with both 💚

Are you new to this whole Dog Mom/Dog Dad thing? Fear not! Today is National Responsible Dog Ownership Day and while there are no days off when it comes to doing the very best for your dog, we’ve rounded up 7 simple ways to let you know you’re on the right track!⁠
⁠
Exercise:⁠
Your pup needs both physical and mental exercise. Make time for regular walks, games, food puzzles, throwing a ball, etc. Anything to stimulate their mind and body.⁠
⁠
Veterinary Care:⁠
Schedule regular checkups and make sure your dog is up to date on their vaccinations. When in doubt, let your vet check it out!⁠
⁠
Grooming:⁠
From regular coat brushing, nail clipping and tooth brushing, grooming is an important part of pet parenthood. Our hypoallergenic dog wipes are a great option for in-between baths.⁠
⁠
Training:⁠
Set your dog up for success with consistent and positive training. Learning basic commands and a new trick here and there is fun for you and your pup.⁠
⁠
ID Tags/Microchip:⁠
Keeping your dog's tags and microchip up-to-date is invaluable in case you know who decide to make a run for it.⁠
⁠
Picking Up After Your Dog:⁠
Keep public spaces clean, green, and dog-friendly by bringing a solid supply of dog poop bags with you.⁠
⁠
Love:⁠
We can all agree that our dogs are family. Show them the endless amount of love they give to you!

Trick train your pup so they can help you around the house 💕 #EarthRatedPartner

Since training Kaia to pick things up off the ground, my back never suffers! She cleans her toys, picks up her leash, or anything that has fallen! We love that @earthrated helps make life simpler for dog owners in every way, too. From easy wipes, innovative dog poop holders, and great toys to keep them busy.

How do you like to wind down? #Ad 

For Mackenzie, being a dogfluencer can be a lot of hard work, and sometimes a little spa sesh can help her feel rejuvenated. One of her fav parts of her spa treatment is her wipedown with @earthrated Lavender Scented Wipes, because they’re super soft and gentle on her sensitive skin and extra relaxing. 

This Black Friday, you can snag some for your dog and get up to 20% off to keep your pup clean and ready for the upcoming holiday season!

Dog shelters and rescues are a vital part of the Earth Rated community, and they're facing more pressure than ever to accommodate an increase in surrendered animals. In honour of #NationalAdoptAShelterDogMonth we're shining a light on all the ways that fostering, and fostering-to-adopt can help shelters out by freeing up space for other dogs in need.⁠
⁠
To help set up foster families for success we even designed special kits of conveniently packed Earth Rated best sellers. Our kits include lavender-scented poop bags, a poop bag dispenser, and a chic branded bandana.⁠
⁠
We want to inspire people around us to be a part of this experience and welcome you to nominate a shelter or rescue for a chance to receive a donation of foster kits from us. To enter, tell us why they are so amazing through the link in our bio!

Atlas loves to get messy so I always keep @earthrated wipes at the front door and in the backyard for easy and quick cleanups. The wipes are thick and durable + hypoallergenic, great for all paws big and small!

Information & Resources 👇🏻
 
Before we get into the nitty gritty – give our awesome partners @earthrated a follow & drop a 💚 in the comments to get added to their close friend list where you’ll get access to more useful info for pet parents & be entered in some exclusive giveaways. 
 
Tip #1: Comfort Mat: Why? How?!
A comfort mat is great for helping dogs feel calm & confident.  You’ll need a rug, some lavender, yummy food & a calming enrichment toy – the @earthrated CHEW is our pick. Find a quiet spot when you have 3-5 minutes & follow the steps below:
1. Spritz your mat with Lavender & let it settle for 15 minutes. Dogs use their sense of smell to assess situations & pairing the lavender scent can add a layer of familiarity to the rug & the calm feelings. 
2. Lay your mat down, sit in front of it & invite your dog to lay on the mat (you can lure them with a high value treat)
3. Give your dog a few treats to reward them for staying on the mat, there is no behaviour requirement, just rewarding for being on the mat.
4. Offer the enrichment item & sit with them.  I suggest the CHEW, as it allows for an outlet to lick & chew; mastication is a scientifically proven behaviour to better cope with stress!
5. Offer them more treats when they finish.
6. Toss some treats away from the mat, pick the mat up and put it away.
 
Tip #2: Cooperative Care is all about having your pet being a willing participant in their required care.  Check my LinkTree for some resources to get started.
 
Tip #3: Provide your pet with some enrichment prior to their appointment; you want them in a relaxed & calm state for their appointment.  We like to use an enrichment toy like the Earth Rated TREAT, and a quiet walk in the woods.
 
Tip #4: Take their comfort mat, treats & their favourite enrichment toy (@earthrated Chew!)
Bonus: if your pet isn’t comfortable with handling, ask your vet if they can get down to your pet’s level & limit handling to a minimum.
 
Tip #5: Decompression activities are very important after stressful events. Our routine looks similar to Step 3.

Don’t forget to drop a 💚 in the comments & Save this post for later.

This one tip made dog mom life easier ⬇️ 

The amount of times I clean floors and wash sheets because of my goldendoodle puppy…🙄

I use @earthrated wipes every day now, because giving Knox a bath every week would dry out his skin. Keeps him clean. My house is clean. WIN!

Make sure you’re also brushing your goldendoodle every single day to prevent mats!

How do you turn your walks from stinkin’ chaos to wonderful bliss? 😌

I keep our walks as hands-free as possible by…

🐾 Securing the leash to my belt
🐾 Using the hook on my @earthrated dispenser to cary used 💩 bags
🐾 Wearing a waist pack for treats, my phone, etc.

P.S. RIP the phone in the first clip… that, my friends, was a real life accident that made the final cut ☠️

Hershey loves to play tug and thrash his toys around. TUG’s ergonomic shape and two handles ensures my hand doesn’t get in the way by accident (those little teeth can pack a punch!) 😅. It’s also super cool to look at!

Do you play tug with your dog?

❤️‍🔥 SALE ALERT! ⬇️ Comment “LINK” ⬇️ for a discount code & link to grab one!

TIPS 💡
✅ Like it is with all enrichment games, make sure you don’t make it too hard for your dog.  Don’t put food where your dog can’t get it.
✅Supervise your dogs closely the first few times they use it to ensure they can access all food without frustration.

Some of the spreadable things we like to use in it:
Peanut Butter
Cream Cheese
Wet Dog Food
Yogurt
Pumpkin
*optional – add some extra flavour with crushed treats

Follow @toosmartdogs for more Canine Enrichment for your high energy dog! 🧠💡

Mornings are busy enough as a mom, I love that @earthrated makes responsible products so I have one less thing to worry about. Their doggy poop bags are made with over 65% post consumer recycled plastic, they’re leak proof and sturdy. And the company is B-Corp certified.  My kids are learning about plastic use in school, so they ask a lot of questions.  When they see us scooping up poop in bags, they want to know what happens to those bags and where they came from, so it’s important to me to be able to answer them honestly and with a socially responsible answer I can be proud of supporting. PS, we order our bags from Amazon and they have a ‘Subscribe & Save’ option, so it takes the brainwork out of making sure you’re always fully stocked. #earthrated #sponsored

The pups love their brand new toy line that just dropped and have had the last few weeks to test them out. Seriously! They’re made from natural rubber so they’re extra tough and can’t be destroyed.

Cure your dog's boredom using 1 toy, 3 different ways - featuring @EarthRated's new Chew Toy. #ad

Enrichment is a big deal in our house and there is nothing I love more than a good chew toy that has multiple uses!

Thankfully, @EarthRated has launched a new line of toys and I couldn't wait to put them to the test! 

Their new Chew Toy can be used in so many ways, but here are my top 3:

1) Made from natural rubber, this toy is super tough & durable yet gentle on your dog’s gums (something I am extra mindful of with my senior dogs). It has enough room to put treats inside of it while also allowing for enough movement and airflow to engage your dog's focus and problem-solving skills, safely.

2) The toy has 2 open ends which makes it a safe option for spreading some dog-safe peanut butter, yogurt, or wet dog food on the end of it. (Bonus points for this toy being freezer-safe!) Pop it in the freezer for a nice cool summer treat and add some extra time to this enriching activity. It's also dishwasher safe, so clean-up is easy.

3) It's ergonomic shape (literally made for paws!) makes it a great option for holding a bully stick or other type treat comfortably, for prolonged play and chew time! 

Enrichment is a great way to keep your dog busy, tire them out a bit, and can also be used to improve their behavior like helping to keep them calmer around guests, if they need to spend some time in their crate or pen, etc. When in doubt, give them some enrichment to help keep them calmer, happier, and more fulfilled!

You can find & shop the entire @EarthRated toy collection online now at @Chewy.

You know it's springtime when...#ad

I can honestly say that our @earthrated wipes have been nothing but amazing ALL YEAR ROUND, especially during spring when our backyard has turned into a literal mud pit. It's nice to quickly wipe his paws down without throwing him into the bathtub every time he comes inside from a bathroom break.

But really...is that mud I'm wiping off his paws or something else? 👀 You tell me!

5 WAYS WE USE THE CHEW 👇🏻

1. Stuffed with a chew! It allows the dog to hold it easily and extends chewing time.
2. Stuffed with oversized treats.  This encourages the dog to chew, to break up the pieces to get them out.
3. Peanut butter (or another dog friendly spreadable) smeared inside.  This lasts surprisingly long – about 10 minutes for 1tbsp.
4. Seal one end, stuff with kibble, seal the other end & (optional) freeze!
5. Seal one end, fill with bone broth, seal the other end & freeze.

Versatile, designed with the dog in mind, durable, ergonomic, affordable & dishwasher safe!  Honestly, it’s a home run in my books.

You can grab one & check out the other new @earthrated toys on Amazon & Chewy now at the link in my bio!

🎥: @johnisforthedogs 

We’re so proud to be working with John on this shelter giveaway! Here’s what he had to say: 

“October is Shelter Dog month and to celebrate this I am teaming up with Earth Rated to help some shelter dogs! As many of you know, Earthrated supports a staggering amount of rescue organizations (+11,500) and they want to help out even more. There are so many great organizations out there that could use some help, and we need you to tell us who they are.

You can nominate a deserving shelter by clicking the link in our bios and telling us who is great and why. I nominated the shelter I got my dog Bones from this morning and it is free and only took a minute. Earthrated will be giving away the foster kits shown to the winning shelters to make it easier for the homes the dogs find.

This is a subject that is very near and dear to my heart, and I am so excited for this partnership. We are going to be doing a series on shelter dogs that I hope will bring some attention to some dogs who deserve their chance, as well as which dogs might be right for which lifestyle. There is a dog for everyone, but not every dog is for everyone.

So please enter the giveaway and stay tuned as we showcase some deserving dogs!”

I’ve been a dog-mom for almost 8 years and an @earthrated customer since. With two pretty big dogs we go through so many poop bags!  I love the Earth Rated bags for many reasons, the durability and thoughtful design are just two of them. Their new bag refills even have a little warning once you get to the end of your roll so you’re always aware that you need to restock! So smart! You guys can buy them in a lot of pet stores but if you do it through Amazon, there’s a 'Subscribe & Save' option which saves you time and $$! #earthrated #sponsored

I am obsessed with finding simple and affordable ways to incorporate enrichment into Hershey’s daily activities. Mental stimulation is very important for dogs!

A great way to do this is to feed meals using enrichment toys like this one, Treat, from @earthrated’s new toy collection. I love the way it rolls, wobbles and encourages interaction. Did I mention it’s made from natural rubber (making it super durable) and dishwasher safe?

How do you incorporate enrichment into your dog’s meals?

Is your dog scared of fireworks? Follow these steps to help soothe your pup! 

1. Give your dog a safe place to go. 

When fear strikes, there’s nothing like hiding somewhere comforting and familiar. 

Where does your dog feel the safest? If they’re crate trained, guide them there when fireworks start going off. Do they have a favorite corner? Make sure it’s not blocked off.

2. Be there for them.

Your dog’s favorite “security blanket” is you! If you can, being home to reassure your pup will help them feel safer.

The key to keeping your dog calm is to show them a few firecrackers are no big deal. If your dog begins to whimper, gently comfort them and reassure them everything is going to be alright.

3. Play relaxing music.

Sudden loud noises seem scarier among dead silence. Even out the noise level with some relaxing music or TV to avoid jump scares.

Did these tips help? Let us know!

Fall weather means more couch and bed cuddles with your pup! Ensure mud and dirt stay at the door with these steps to help them feel more comfortable with wiping their paws.
#EarthRatedPartner

Things to keep in mind:

1. Go at your dog’s pace. Move to the next step only when the are comfortable at the current one. 

2. If they’re pulling away, go back a step or take a break.

3. If your dog needs to have their paws wiped before they are comfortable with it, do your best to redirect their attention with treats on the ground or in a snuffle mat.

Who decided to make January National Walk Your Dog Month? 🥶 #AD #EarthRatedPartner

Ever since the New Year I've been trying to make a habit out of getting outdoors for a walk, snow or shine, but does anyone else hate trying to find poop in the snow? It just instantly melts and disappears?

I REFUSE to be the person who leaves their poop for others to find after it melts! I will stand there for 10 minutes with an @earthrated poop bag in hand trying to find it. Thankfully Widget knows "Find your poop" and will help sniff it out for me. 

Also another pro tip, @earthrated's poop bag dispenser has a signature hook so you don't even have to worry about cold hands on your walk home with your 💩! It's a hands-free experience!

How do you find poop in the snow? Do you try to find the steam? 💩💩💩 Let me know!

We were so moved by Jon Stewart’s tribute to his pup, Dipper and couldn’t help but be reminded of all the good boys and girls we’ve shared our lives with. We wanted to share them here with you.

In tribute to Dipper and all the dogs that hold a special place in our hearts, we’ve decided to make a donation to @animalhaven rescue in New York City.

We’ve all experienced the joy of having a dog like Dipper. Tell us about yours.

👇 3 grooming tips to make your life easier! #EarthRatedPartner

1️⃣ Store wipes where you use them–like in a basket by the door–so you don’t have to run through the house with a muddy-pawed dog waiting at the door 

(Bonus: the @earthrated wipes packaging is so pretty that they won’t be an eyesore!)

2️⃣ Wear a headlamp when trimming your pup’s nails to make it easier to see their quick

3️⃣ Have a small, short-haired dog that doesn’t require a lot of grooming! (OK, this one is partially a joke, but choosing a dog with a manageable amount of grooming for your lifestyle is important!!)

💬 We’re all in this together, so share your best grooming “hacks” in the comments!

A very important #PupTip courtesy of @untrainablenorahbones “to avoid running out of poop bags during your dog walk. Always bring an extra roll, and when you put it in the dispenser, replace it with another extra as soon as you can. Make it a habit.”

Dog walking hacks to help your walks go easier! #ad 

The new and improved @earthrated poop bag dispenser and bags help us stay well-prepared on our walks and let outs in the yard. Since my worst nightmare is being caught without any poop bags, it’s very helpful that their bags have a “3 bags left” label on every roll. 

Prevent your dog from dragging you down the street mid pick-up by using some treats to train your dog to sit, lie down, or even simply stand still while you clean up. 

Bonus Tip: If your dog is having a bit of trouble holding position, try breaking down the sequence into smaller parts and reward your dog more frequently in the beginning of training this.

The way this dispenser is now an accessory 💅🏼 | ad

But seriously, dog stuff doesn’t have to be boring. And it definitely doesn’t have to ruin your outfit. AND you do not have to sacrifice function!

These new features are game changers:

1. Signature Dispenser Hook — hold your used 💩 bags to keep your hands free and clean until you find a garbage!
2. Durable, Silicone Handle — easy to attach to any leash, and SECURE 🔒
3. Bag Warnings — never run out of bags again! These new bags will tell you when you’re on your last 3
4. Click and Lock Closure — keeps those bags from unravelling and flying around in the wind

Which one is your favourite? #earthrated #earthratedpartner

Mega Maize popping in to share an awesome @earthrated update! #ad 

If you have or have ever had a dog, then you know they’re all super in their own unique way. 

This month, for Adopt a Shelter Pet month, @earthrated is being the superhero dogs need and calling on us to help! They're giving away cases of super cozy, shelter-friendly blankets to organizations (and their dogs!) who need them, and need YOU to help determine which ones! Whether your dog is a rescue, you volunteer at a shelter, or you just want to see a shelter in your community uplifted, Maisie & I encourage you to head to their website to become a #sheltersuperhero too by nominating one today. Find the link in our bio!

We nominated the Humane Society of Tampa for all the awesome work they do in our community! 
The campaign runs until Nov. 2nd... will you answer the call?

Enrichment made better 💚 #EarthRatedPartner 

I bet you have a dog that’s got so much energy, even after long adventures and constant play. That’s Kaia. So she *needs* mental stimulation at home. Ryuu is currently on an outside-world-detox: he is anxious after the big move, and the fireworks in the neighbourhood have not helped… so he also *needs* mental enrichment! 🧠 

Thankfully, @earthrated just released it’s first-ever collection of thoughtfully designed dog toys! These awesome new Chew & Treat toys are our faves. The Chew is easily stuffed with anything you want (we did peanut butter here, but it’s wide enough to put in bones or bully sticks in!) The Treat toy is great for putting their meals in. It took a bit for Ryuu to learn how to move it to get the treats out, but that’s the best thing about these puzzles!! It's just enough work to keep them engaged, but not too hard to get frustrated. Both toys are made from responsibly sourced natural rubber, are freezer & dishwasher safe (!) and extra durable for the dogs! 

You can find them all now on Amazon!

[id: a carousel of images collaged together. The first slide shows Kaia, a red and white corgi, licking from a green chew toy. She is on a brown leather couch. On the carpet in front of her is Ryuu, a red Shiba Inu who sniffs at an oblong green toy. In the next slide, Kaia is shown with the long chew toy, her paw over it. The next slide shows Kaia’s paw with peanut butter on it, a shelf of books, a plant, and hands holding the chew toy with a spoon of peanut butter in the other. The last slide shows Ryuu pawing at the treat toy and Kaia sniffing it.]

The moment you throw your dog’s favourite toy in the water and they don’t fetch it.. #ad 

Instead of being angry about having to get into the cold mountain lake... I decided to make the best of a cold situation and join Apollo in the water for some fun! 

Once I got in the water, Apollo found it a lot more fun to swim and fetch his @earthrated fly & fetch toys! Playing together is always better... but I’ll keep that in mind before I throw another toy in a freezing cold lake again 😜

💻 CHEW — spread some dog-safe peanut butter or yogurt or banana (whatever your heart desires!) and let your pup go to town chewing, licking, and chomping. The design makes it easy for little Lenny paws to hold and work on the enrichment by herself (can you say independent girly 💅🏼🐾) 
 
💻 TREAT — lunch time! Fill the toy with your dog’s meal and extend the time it takes for them to eat 🍗 This engages their natural instincts and allows them to work for their food. Lenny goes from 30 second meals in a bowl to 30 minutes foraging in the yard 🤓 
 
When they’re all tuckered out, toss them all in the dishwasher and get back to work 🫡 #EarthRatedPartner #EarthRated

More on how to teach this perfect-for-photos trick ⬇️
#EarthRatedPartner

Start with an easy-to-balance item, like a soft toy, and later try more unique items—like @earthrated’s poop bag rolls! (Seriously, I’m obsessed with these—did you know they have a sticker to tell you when the roll is almost out??)

The most important thing when teaching your dog this trick is to make sure they’re comfortable with it—because no photo or trick is worth stressing your dog out!

Move the item closer just a fraction of an inch at a time, and only progress if your dog is relaxed and successfully remaining still. Reward the little successes, and never punish your dog for moving or force them to stay still!

Let us know if you try this trick!

How much enrichment does your dog need? ⬇️
 
There is no set amount of enrichment dogs require & it looks different for every dog. Enrichment is about meeting the needs of your individual dog.
 
Sometimes that looks like enrichment toys (like some of the ones you saw in this video).

Sometimes it looks like getting out for a sniff & a dig.

Sometimes it looks like spending quality time with their favourite people or dog friends.

& sometimes it looks like having a quiet place to sleep…

it can also looks like working on skills required for everyday life (in a stress-free way)!
 
There are so many ways enrichment falls into daily life.
 
What is most important is that you observe your dog, what they thoroughly enjoy & try to offer it to them regularly. 
 
Products in this video are all @earthrated…
We had their wipes, chew, fetch & treat toys.  All quality products we use on a regular basis & love!

This trick is a lot to fit into one reel, so check out the extra tips below! #EarthRatedPartner

“Basketball” is a great example of how mastering the basics can lend itself to really cool tricks! We’re really just combining these three skills:

🎾 Retrieve: To teach your dog to retrieve a ball, you’ll need something easy to hold like the Fetch from @earthrated. You can shape the behavior by holding the ball and rewarding when your dog sniffs, touches, nibbles, and finally takes the ball. Transition to holding the ball on the floor and moving it farther away. 

If your dog already loves to fetch, you can toss the ball and reward when they retrieve it. Work up to tossing the ball less until they will take it when stationary. 

🏀 Nose target: It’s helpful if you dog is familiar with targeting your hand or a disc/stick with your nose. You can use those to bridge to targeting the hoop, or this is a really fun behavior to shape! Sitting behind the hoop and tossing rewards away helps create the motion of going toward the hoop. Reward anything close to touching the hoop—ideally the inside—with their nose, and start rewarding from inside the hoop once they catch on. 

😮 Drop it: Ask your dog to drop the ball with your hand right below it, then slowly start moving your hand farther away so your dog learns to target something before dropping the ball. 

Once your dog masters these skills individually, it’s just a matter of stringing them together to create the final trick!
