10’s across the board in my books! Lenny’s got her preferences though, as I’m sure your dog does too 🐶 Good thing this launch has something for every pup 😍 | ad 
 
Lenny’s favs as a 32 lb gentle, fetch-fanatic: 
 
- FETCH (obviously) 
- TREAT (bit of a brainiac) 
- FLY (another floater!!) 
 
CHEW would be awesome for holding bully sticks or for dogs who love to chew 🦴  
 
And TUG would be SO good for a rough & tough typa dog 💪🏼  
 
You can shop the new collection in our Amazon storefront! 🛒

Dog Enrichment Obstacle Course for the Great Indoors! #ad

🐾 Here’s how to do it:

- grab some of your dog’s favorite toys and place them around
- fill a treat dispensing toy and add that to the course
- hide some treats around the toys and items

Sit back and watch your dog enjoy this unique enrichment game! This type of activity is great for any type of day, but can be especially helpful on days where you think you may be spending more time inside.

I couldn’t contain my excitement when @earthrated announced they were making toys!! #ad 

Time to meet the collection! ⬇️

Fetch: a thoughtfully designed ball with a unique shape that bounces unpredictably and floats! 

Tug: designed with 2 handles for interactive play and an ergonomic shape, supporting natural range of motion!

Chew: a re-imagination of a traditional bone, allowing dogs to chew, chomp and gnaw at dry treats, peanut butter or bully stick you’ve stuffed it with!

Treat: a fully interactive and rewarding experience for your dog with a wobbly rolling shape that provides mental stimulation! 

Fly: an engaging toss, jump and catch experience with a rolled edge and hollow centre to ensure any dog can pick it up. It also floats for fun in the water! 

Each toy is made from natural rubber and rigorously tested for toughness!! 💪🏻 

Which one would your dog love??
💚💛 Apollo’s top picks are Fetch and Chew! 🏆

@laducb knows all about making sure you and your pup are prepared for adventure on #NationalTakeAHikeDay ⁠
⁠
“Have you ever had that mortifying moment where your dog is pooping and you don’t have a poop bag?⁠
⁠
I’ve been there and it is incredibly embarrassing and awkward. I’ll even admit, I have even pretended to pick it up just so I look less irresponsible, and I never want to have to do that again! Sure, it is easy to forget a bag, but really it doesn’t have to be! Especially with the @earthrated poop bag dispensers that can attach easily to a leash or a pack and even has a built-in clip to carry used bags!"

Our latest and greatest tool for travel prep: @earthrated’s Chew Toy #ad

While prepping for our latest trip, having an engaging and durable toy like Earth Rated’s Chew Toy was a huge help for getting Maisie accustomed to her carrier. Prior to flying we like to reintroduce her carrier accompanied by high value treats and engaging toys like this one to encourage her to interact with and spend time in her carrier. Being able to travel with Maisie is such a privilege and her comfort and confidence is so important, and I’m thankful that Earth Rated has such engaging and practical toys to help us with both 💚

Are you new to this whole Dog Mom/Dog Dad thing? Fear not! Today is National Responsible Dog Ownership Day and while there are no days off when it comes to doing the very best for your dog, we’ve rounded up 7 simple ways to let you know you’re on the right track!⁠
⁠
Exercise:⁠
Your pup needs both physical and mental exercise. Make time for regular walks, games, food puzzles, throwing a ball, etc. Anything to stimulate their mind and body.⁠
⁠
Veterinary Care:⁠
Schedule regular checkups and make sure your dog is up to date on their vaccinations. When in doubt, let your vet check it out!⁠
⁠
Grooming:⁠
From regular coat brushing, nail clipping and tooth brushing, grooming is an important part of pet parenthood. Our hypoallergenic dog wipes are a great option for in-between baths.⁠
⁠
Training:⁠
Set your dog up for success with consistent and positive training. Learning basic commands and a new trick here and there is fun for you and your pup.⁠
⁠
ID Tags/Microchip:⁠
Keeping your dog's tags and microchip up-to-date is invaluable in case you know who decide to make a run for it.⁠
⁠
Picking Up After Your Dog:⁠
Keep public spaces clean, green, and dog-friendly by bringing a solid supply of dog poop bags with you.⁠
⁠
Love:⁠
We can all agree that our dogs are family. Show them the endless amount of love they give to you!

Since training Kaia to pick things up off the ground, my back never suffers! She cleans her toys, picks up her leash, or anything that has fallen! We love that @earthrated helps make life simpler for dog owners in every way, too. From easy wipes, innovative dog poop holders, and great toys to keep them busy.

For Mackenzie, being a dogfluencer can be a lot of hard work, and sometimes a little spa sesh can help her feel rejuvenated. One of her fav parts of her spa treatment is her wipedown with @earthrated Lavender Scented Wipes, because they’re super soft and gentle on her sensitive skin and extra relaxing. 

This Black Friday, you can snag some for your dog and get up to 20% off to keep your pup clean and ready for the upcoming holiday season!

Dog shelters and rescues are a vital part of the Earth Rated community, and they're facing more pressure than ever to accommodate an increase in surrendered animals. In honour of #NationalAdoptAShelterDogMonth we're shining a light on all the ways that fostering, and fostering-to-adopt can help shelters out by freeing up space for other dogs in need.⁠
⁠
To help set up foster families for success we even designed special kits of conveniently packed Earth Rated best sellers. Our kits include lavender-scented poop bags, a poop bag dispenser, and a chic branded bandana.⁠
⁠
We want to inspire people around us to be a part of this experience and welcome you to nominate a shelter or rescue for a chance to receive a donation of foster kits from us. To enter, tell us why they are so amazing through the link in our bio!

Muddy wet paw prints on the floor and rugs? We’ve all been there🥴 No matter the messes - having a dog is still stinkin' wonderful🥹

Atlas loves to get messy so I always keep @earthrated wipes at the front door and in the backyard for easy and quick cleanups. The wipes are thick and durable + hypoallergenic, great for all paws big and small!

Information & Resources 👇🏻
 
Before we get into the nitty gritty – give our awesome partners @earthrated a follow & drop a 💚 in the comments to get added to their close friend list where you’ll get access to more useful info for pet parents & be entered in some exclusive giveaways. 
 
Tip #1: Comfort Mat: Why? How?!
A comfort mat is great for helping dogs feel calm & confident.  You’ll need a rug, some lavender, yummy food & a calming enrichment toy – the @earthrated CHEW is our pick. Find a quiet spot when you have 3-5 minutes & follow the steps below:
1. Spritz your mat with Lavender & let it settle for 15 minutes. Dogs use their sense of smell to assess situations & pairing the lavender scent can add a layer of familiarity to the rug & the calm feelings. 
2. Lay your mat down, sit in front of it & invite your dog to lay on the mat (you can lure them with a high value treat)
3. Give your dog a few treats to reward them for staying on the mat, there is no behaviour requirement, just rewarding for being on the mat.
4. Offer the enrichment item & sit with them.  I suggest the CHEW, as it allows for an outlet to lick & chew; mastication is a scientifically proven behaviour to better cope with stress!
5. Offer them more treats when they finish.
6. Toss some treats away from the mat, pick the mat up and put it away.
 
Tip #2: Cooperative Care is all about having your pet being a willing participant in their required care.  Check my LinkTree for some resources to get started.
 
Tip #3: Provide your pet with some enrichment prior to their appointment; you want them in a relaxed & calm state for their appointment.  We like to use an enrichment toy like the Earth Rated TREAT, and a quiet walk in the woods.
 
Tip #4: Take their comfort mat, treats & their favourite enrichment toy (@earthrated Chew!)
Bonus: if your pet isn’t comfortable with handling, ask your vet if they can get down to your pet’s level & limit handling to a minimum.
 
Tip #5: Decompression activities are very important after stressful events. Our routine looks similar to Step 3.

Don’t forget to drop a 💚 in the comments & Save this post for later.

This one tip made dog mom life easier ⬇️ 

The amount of times I clean floors and wash sheets because of my goldendoodle puppy…🙄

I use @earthrated wipes every day now, because giving Knox a bath every week would dry out his skin. Keeps him clean. My house is clean. WIN!

Make sure you’re also brushing your goldendoodle every single day to prevent mats!

How do you turn your walks from stinkin’ chaos to wonderful bliss? 😌

I keep our walks as hands-free as possible by…

🐾 Securing the leash to my belt
🐾 Using the hook on my @earthrated dispenser to cary used 💩 bags
🐾 Wearing a waist pack for treats, my phone, etc.

P.S. RIP the phone in the first clip… that, my friends, was a real life accident that made the final cut ☠️

❤️‍🔥 SALE ALERT! ⬇️ Comment “LINK” ⬇️ for a discount code & link to grab one!

TIPS 💡
✅ Like it is with all enrichment games, make sure you don’t make it too hard for your dog.  Don’t put food where your dog can’t get it.
✅Supervise your dogs closely the first few times they use it to ensure they can access all food without frustration.

Some of the spreadable things we like to use in it:
Peanut Butter
Cream Cheese
Wet Dog Food
Yogurt
Pumpkin
*optional – add some extra flavour with crushed treats

Mornings are busy enough as a mom, I love that @earthrated makes responsible products so I have one less thing to worry about. Their doggy poop bags are made with over 65% post consumer recycled plastic, they’re leak proof and sturdy. And the company is B-Corp certified.  My kids are learning about plastic use in school, so they ask a lot of questions.  When they see us scooping up poop in bags, they want to know what happens to those bags and where they came from, so it’s important to me to be able to answer them honestly and with a socially responsible answer I can be proud of supporting. PS, we order our bags from Amazon and they have a ‘Subscribe & Save’ option, so it takes the brainwork out of making sure you’re always fully stocked. #earthrated #sponsored

Cure your dog's boredom using 1 toy, 3 different ways - featuring @EarthRated's new Chew Toy. #ad

Enrichment is a big deal in our house and there is nothing I love more than a good chew toy that has multiple uses!

Thankfully, @EarthRated has launched a new line of toys and I couldn't wait to put them to the test! 

Their new Chew Toy can be used in so many ways, but here are my top 3:

1) Made from natural rubber, this toy is super tough & durable yet gentle on your dog’s gums (something I am extra mindful of with my senior dogs). It has enough room to put treats inside of it while also allowing for enough movement and airflow to engage your dog's focus and problem-solving skills, safely.

2) The toy has 2 open ends which makes it a safe option for spreading some dog-safe peanut butter, yogurt, or wet dog food on the end of it. (Bonus points for this toy being freezer-safe!) Pop it in the freezer for a nice cool summer treat and add some extra time to this enriching activity. It's also dishwasher safe, so clean-up is easy.

3) It's ergonomic shape (literally made for paws!) makes it a great option for holding a bully stick or other type treat comfortably, for prolonged play and chew time! 

Enrichment is a great way to keep your dog busy, tire them out a bit, and can also be used to improve their behavior like helping to keep them calmer around guests, if they need to spend some time in their crate or pen, etc. When in doubt, give them some enrichment to help keep them calmer, happier, and more fulfilled!

You can find & shop the entire @EarthRated toy collection online now at @Chewy.

You know it's springtime when...#ad

I can honestly say that our @earthrated wipes have been nothing but amazing ALL YEAR ROUND, especially during spring when our backyard has turned into a literal mud pit. It's nice to quickly wipe his paws down without throwing him into the bathtub every time he comes inside from a bathroom break.

But really...is that mud I'm wiping off his paws or something else? 👀 You tell me!

5 WAYS WE USE THE CHEW 👇🏻

1. Stuffed with a chew! It allows the dog to hold it easily and extends chewing time.
2. Stuffed with oversized treats.  This encourages the dog to chew, to break up the pieces to get them out.
3. Peanut butter (or another dog friendly spreadable) smeared inside.  This lasts surprisingly long – about 10 minutes for 1tbsp.
4. Seal one end, stuff with kibble, seal the other end & (optional) freeze!
5. Seal one end, fill with bone broth, seal the other end & freeze.

Versatile, designed with the dog in mind, durable, ergonomic, affordable & dishwasher safe!  Honestly, it’s a home run in my books.

You can grab one & check out the other new @earthrated toys on Amazon & Chewy now at the link in my bio!

🎥: @johnisforthedogs 

We’re so proud to be working with John on this shelter giveaway! Here’s what he had to say: 

“October is Shelter Dog month and to celebrate this I am teaming up with Earth Rated to help some shelter dogs! As many of you know, Earthrated supports a staggering amount of rescue organizations (+11,500) and they want to help out even more. There are so many great organizations out there that could use some help, and we need you to tell us who they are.

You can nominate a deserving shelter by clicking the link in our bios and telling us who is great and why. I nominated the shelter I got my dog Bones from this morning and it is free and only took a minute. Earthrated will be giving away the foster kits shown to the winning shelters to make it easier for the homes the dogs find.

This is a subject that is very near and dear to my heart, and I am so excited for this partnership. We are going to be doing a series on shelter dogs that I hope will bring some attention to some dogs who deserve their chance, as well as which dogs might be right for which lifestyle. There is a dog for everyone, but not every dog is for everyone.

So please enter the giveaway and stay tuned as we showcase some deserving dogs!”

I’ve been a dog-mom for almost 8 years and an @earthrated customer since. With two pretty big dogs we go through so many poop bags!  I love the Earth Rated bags for many reasons, the durability and thoughtful design are just two of them. Their new bag refills even have a little warning once you get to the end of your roll so you’re always aware that you need to restock! So smart! You guys can buy them in a lot of pet stores but if you do it through Amazon, there’s a 'Subscribe & Save' option which saves you time and $$! #earthrated #sponsored

I am obsessed with finding simple and affordable ways to incorporate enrichment into Hershey’s daily activities. Mental stimulation is very important for dogs!

A great way to do this is to feed meals using enrichment toys like this one, Treat, from @earthrated’s new toy collection. I love the way it rolls, wobbles and encourages interaction. Did I mention it’s made from natural rubber (making it super durable) and dishwasher safe?

How do you incorporate enrichment into your dog’s meals?

Is your dog scared of fireworks? Follow these steps to help soothe your pup! 

1. Give your dog a safe place to go. 

When fear strikes, there’s nothing like hiding somewhere comforting and familiar. 

Where does your dog feel the safest? If they’re crate trained, guide them there when fireworks start going off. Do they have a favorite corner? Make sure it’s not blocked off.

2. Be there for them.

Your dog’s favorite “security blanket” is you! If you can, being home to reassure your pup will help them feel safer.

The key to keeping your dog calm is to show them a few firecrackers are no big deal. If your dog begins to whimper, gently comfort them and reassure them everything is going to be alright.

3. Play relaxing music.

Sudden loud noises seem scarier among dead silence. Even out the noise level with some relaxing music or TV to avoid jump scares.

Did these tips help? Let us know!

Fall weather means more couch and bed cuddles with your pup! Ensure mud and dirt stay at the door with these steps to help them feel more comfortable with wiping their paws.
#EarthRatedPartner

Things to keep in mind:

1. Go at your dog’s pace. Move to the next step only when the are comfortable at the current one. 

2. If they’re pulling away, go back a step or take a break.

3. If your dog needs to have their paws wiped before they are comfortable with it, do your best to redirect their attention with treats on the ground or in a snuffle mat.

Who decided to make January National Walk Your Dog Month? 🥶 #AD #EarthRatedPartner

Ever since the New Year I've been trying to make a habit out of getting outdoors for a walk, snow or shine, but does anyone else hate trying to find poop in the snow? It just instantly melts and disappears?

I REFUSE to be the person who leaves their poop for others to find after it melts! I will stand there for 10 minutes with an @earthrated poop bag in hand trying to find it. Thankfully Widget knows "Find your poop" and will help sniff it out for me. 

Also another pro tip, @earthrated's poop bag dispenser has a signature hook so you don't even have to worry about cold hands on your walk home with your 💩! It's a hands-free experience!

How do you find poop in the snow? Do you try to find the steam? 💩💩💩 Let me know!

👇 3 grooming tips to make your life easier! #EarthRatedPartner

1️⃣ Store wipes where you use them–like in a basket by the door–so you don’t have to run through the house with a muddy-pawed dog waiting at the door 

(Bonus: the @earthrated wipes packaging is so pretty that they won’t be an eyesore!)

2️⃣ Wear a headlamp when trimming your pup’s nails to make it easier to see their quick

3️⃣ Have a small, short-haired dog that doesn’t require a lot of grooming! (OK, this one is partially a joke, but choosing a dog with a manageable amount of grooming for your lifestyle is important!!)

Dog walking hacks to help your walks go easier! #ad 

The new and improved @earthrated poop bag dispenser and bags help us stay well-prepared on our walks and let outs in the yard. Since my worst nightmare is being caught without any poop bags, it’s very helpful that their bags have a “3 bags left” label on every roll. 

Prevent your dog from dragging you down the street mid pick-up by using some treats to train your dog to sit, lie down, or even simply stand still while you clean up. 

Bonus Tip: If your dog is having a bit of trouble holding position, try breaking down the sequence into smaller parts and reward your dog more frequently in the beginning of training this.

The way this dispenser is now an accessory 💅🏼 | ad

But seriously, dog stuff doesn’t have to be boring. And it definitely doesn’t have to ruin your outfit. AND you do not have to sacrifice function!

These new features are game changers:

1. Signature Dispenser Hook — hold your used 💩 bags to keep your hands free and clean until you find a garbage!
2. Durable, Silicone Handle — easy to attach to any leash, and SECURE 🔒
3. Bag Warnings — never run out of bags again! These new bags will tell you when you’re on your last 3
4. Click and Lock Closure — keeps those bags from unravelling and flying around in the wind

Which one is your favourite? #earthrated #earthratedpartner

Mega Maize popping in to share an awesome @earthrated update! #ad 

If you have or have ever had a dog, then you know they’re all super in their own unique way. 

This month, for Adopt a Shelter Pet month, @earthrated is being the superhero dogs need and calling on us to help! They're giving away cases of super cozy, shelter-friendly blankets to organizations (and their dogs!) who need them, and need YOU to help determine which ones! Whether your dog is a rescue, you volunteer at a shelter, or you just want to see a shelter in your community uplifted, Maisie & I encourage you to head to their website to become a #sheltersuperhero too by nominating one today. Find the link in our bio!

We nominated the Humane Society of Tampa for all the awesome work they do in our community! 
The campaign runs until Nov. 2nd... will you answer the call?

Enrichment made better 💚 #EarthRatedPartner 

I bet you have a dog that’s got so much energy, even after long adventures and constant play. That’s Kaia. So she *needs* mental stimulation at home. Ryuu is currently on an outside-world-detox: he is anxious after the big move, and the fireworks in the neighbourhood have not helped… so he also *needs* mental enrichment! 🧠 

Thankfully, @earthrated just released it’s first-ever collection of thoughtfully designed dog toys! These awesome new Chew & Treat toys are our faves. The Chew is easily stuffed with anything you want (we did peanut butter here, but it’s wide enough to put in bones or bully sticks in!) The Treat toy is great for putting their meals in. It took a bit for Ryuu to learn how to move it to get the treats out, but that’s the best thing about these puzzles!! It's just enough work to keep them engaged, but not too hard to get frustrated. Both toys are made from responsibly sourced natural rubber, are freezer & dishwasher safe (!) and extra durable for the dogs! 

You can find them all now on Amazon!

[id: a carousel of images collaged together. The first slide shows Kaia, a red and white corgi, licking from a green chew toy. She is on a brown leather couch. On the carpet in front of her is Ryuu, a red Shiba Inu who sniffs at an oblong green toy. In the next slide, Kaia is shown with the long chew toy, her paw over it. The next slide shows Kaia’s paw with peanut butter on it, a shelf of books, a plant, and hands holding the chew toy with a spoon of peanut butter in the other. The last slide shows Ryuu pawing at the treat toy and Kaia sniffing it.]

The moment you throw your dog’s favourite toy in the water and they don’t fetch it.. #ad 

Instead of being angry about having to get into the cold mountain lake... I decided to make the best of a cold situation and join Apollo in the water for some fun! 

Once I got in the water, Apollo found it a lot more fun to swim and fetch his @earthrated fly & fetch toys! Playing together is always better... but I’ll keep that in mind before I throw another toy in a freezing cold lake again 😜

WFH enrichment essentials ⤵️ 
 
Even on the busiest of work days, the dogs need something to do! There’s something for every dog in the new Earth Rated collection, but I’ve been loving these toys to stuff and toss in the backyard for Lenny to keep herself busy | ad 
 
💻 CHEW — spread some dog-safe peanut butter or yogurt or banana (whatever your heart desires!) and let your pup go to town chewing, licking, and chomping. The design makes it easy for little Lenny paws to hold and work on the enrichment by herself (can you say independent girly 💅🏼🐾) 
 
💻 TREAT — lunch time! Fill the toy with your dog’s meal and extend the time it takes for them to eat 🍗 This engages their natural instincts and allows them to work for their food. Lenny goes from 30 second meals in a bowl to 30 minutes foraging in the yard 🤓 
 
When they’re all tuckered out, toss them all in the dishwasher and get back to work 🫡 #EarthRatedPartner #EarthRated

More on how to teach this perfect-for-photos trick ⬇️
#EarthRatedPartner

Start with an easy-to-balance item, like a soft toy, and later try more unique items—like @earthrated’s poop bag rolls! (Seriously, I’m obsessed with these—did you know they have a sticker to tell you when the roll is almost out??)

The most important thing when teaching your dog this trick is to make sure they’re comfortable with it—because no photo or trick is worth stressing your dog out!

Move the item closer just a fraction of an inch at a time, and only progress if your dog is relaxed and successfully remaining still. Reward the little successes, and never punish your dog for moving or force them to stay still!

Let us know if you try this trick!

How much enrichment does your dog need? ⬇️
 
There is no set amount of enrichment dogs require & it looks different for every dog. Enrichment is about meeting the needs of your individual dog.
 
Sometimes that looks like enrichment toys (like some of the ones you saw in this video).

Sometimes it looks like getting out for a sniff & a dig.

Sometimes it looks like spending quality time with their favourite people or dog friends.

& sometimes it looks like having a quiet place to sleep…

it can also looks like working on skills required for everyday life (in a stress-free way)!
 
There are so many ways enrichment falls into daily life.
 
What is most important is that you observe your dog, what they thoroughly enjoy & try to offer it to them regularly. 
 
Products in this video are all @earthrated…
We had their wipes, chew, fetch & treat toys.  All quality products we use on a regular basis & love!

This trick is a lot to fit into one reel, so check out the extra tips below! #EarthRatedPartner

“Basketball” is a great example of how mastering the basics can lend itself to really cool tricks! We’re really just combining these three skills:

🎾 Retrieve: To teach your dog to retrieve a ball, you’ll need something easy to hold like the Fetch from @earthrated. You can shape the behavior by holding the ball and rewarding when your dog sniffs, touches, nibbles, and finally takes the ball. Transition to holding the ball on the floor and moving it farther away. 

If your dog already loves to fetch, you can toss the ball and reward when they retrieve it. Work up to tossing the ball less until they will take it when stationary. 

🏀 Nose target: It’s helpful if you dog is familiar with targeting your hand or a disc/stick with your nose. You can use those to bridge to targeting the hoop, or this is a really fun behavior to shape! Sitting behind the hoop and tossing rewards away helps create the motion of going toward the hoop. Reward anything close to touching the hoop—ideally the inside—with their nose, and start rewarding from inside the hoop once they catch on. 

😮 Drop it: Ask your dog to drop the ball with your hand right below it, then slowly start moving your hand farther away so your dog learns to target something before dropping the ball. 

Once your dog masters these skills individually, it’s just a matter of stringing them together to create the final trick!
